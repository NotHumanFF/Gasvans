## Node JS
It is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications.
Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
